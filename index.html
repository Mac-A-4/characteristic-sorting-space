                <b>Suggested Use of Characteristic Sorting Space</b>
                <br><br>
                This sorting space is a tool for thinking about various personal characteristics and how they relate to identities such as Giftedness and Autism. You can add any identities and characteristics you would like to work with to the list by typing into the ADD NEW box and pressing Enter. New entries will disappear if you reload the tool.
                <br><br>
                The cylinder in the middle casts a rectangular shadow when a light shines on it from the left, and a circular shadow when a light shines on it from above. In a way, the cylinder has attributes of both the rectangle and the circle even though it is neither! We can explore various personal identities in this way as well by thinking about how our characteristics appear in the light of our various identities.
                <br><br>
                Choose an identity or characteristic from the list by clicking on it. Then move your pointer over the sorting space image and click to place it in one of the colored regions. You can click it again to move it to a different area. You can also remove it by moving it back to the list.
                <br><br>
                You may find that some of your characteristics belong to more than one identity. There may be items in the list that you do not identify with, you do not need to use everything in the list. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here, this is a tool for exploration and conversation.
